# Keylogger
This C++ project implements a basic keylogger, a tool that tracks and logs keystrokes on a computer system. It utilizes Windows APIs to monitor keyboard input and then saves the recorded keystrokes to a text file. The program captures standard keystrokes, as well as special keys like space, tab, and delete, and recognizes the state of toggled keys like Caps Lock and Shift. While it's a simple implementation, it emphasizes the importance of understanding security and privacy issues in software development.
